                 <h3>Bringing joy and fun to a festivity of Peace</h3>

                <p>
                    In 2011, with permission from the Benin monarch, The Hexagon Network set out on a mission to rebrand and repackage the Benin festival celebrations, which included the famous Igue festival.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We set out to create a compelling and colourful event with the inclusion of several new activities – A beauty pageant, classical drama presentations, street carnivals, art events and live music festivals. Since then, the festivities have witnessed an astonishing increase in the number of participation from the younger generations and conservatives alike.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The festivity is an annual event and our vision is to make it one of the best celebrations in Africa.
